## 📂 Dataset
**Adult Income Dataset**  
Files used:
- adult.data
- adult.test
- adult.names

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Identified categorical and numerical features.
3. Handled missing values by removing invalid entries.
4. Applied Label Encoding on the target column.
5. Applied One-Hot Encoding on nominal categorical features.
6. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
7. Saved the processed dataset as `adult_preprocessed.csv`.

## 📊 Why Encoding & Scaling?

- Encoding converts categorical data into numerical form.
- Scaling ensures all numerical features contribute equally to model training.
- These steps improve accuracy and performance of ML algorithms.
